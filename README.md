# Responsive-Portfolio-Project

<!-- Beging text -->

Here you will find a Responsive Portfolio Project showcasing my ability to utilize CSS Bootstrap. 
The project focuses on the alignment of elements with the grid system and shows the viewer how elements can be successfully displayed in a neat and chronological order.
The viewer will find an interactive nav bar that allows them to navigate to 3 different unique pages and view that pages corresponding content.
Another main goal for this project is to make sure that the page loads correctly in different enviornments (Ipad, Samsung Galaxy, IphoneX, Computer, etc).
